--- Part Two ---

In the interest of trying to align a little better, the generators get more
picky about the numbers they actually give to the judge.

They still generate values in the same way, but now they only hand a value to
the judge when it meets their criteria:

    Generator A looks for values that are multiples of 4.
    Generator B looks for values that are multiples of 8.

Each generator functions completely independently: they both go through values
entirely on their own, only occasionally handing an acceptable value to the
judge, and otherwise working through the same sequence of values as before
until they find one.

The judge still waits for each generator to provide it with a value before
comparing them (using the same comparison method as before). It keeps track of
the order it receives values; the first values from each generator are
compared, then the second values from each generator, then the third values,
and so on.

Using the example starting values given above, the generators now produce the
following first five values each:

--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--
1352636452  1233683848
1992081072   862516352
 530830436  1159784568
1980017072  1616057672
 740335192   412269392

These values have the following corresponding binary values:

01010000100111111001100000100100
01001001100010001000010110001000

01110110101111001011111010110000
00110011011010001111010010000000

00011111101000111101010001100100
01000101001000001110100001111000

01110110000001001010100110110000
01100000010100110001010101001000

00101100001000001001111001011000
00011000100100101011101101010000

Unfortunately, even though this change makes more bits similar on average, none
of these values' lowest 16 bits match. Now, it's not until the 1056th pair that
the judge finds the first match:

--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--
1023762912   896885216

00111101000001010110000111100000
00110101011101010110000111100000

This change makes the generators much slower, and the judge is getting
impatient; it is now only willing to consider 5 million pairs. (Using the
values from the example above, after five million pairs, the judge would
eventually find a total of 309 pairs that match in their lowest 16 bits.)

After 5 million pairs, but using this new generator logic, what is the judge's
final count?
